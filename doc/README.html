<u><b>FinalPM</b></u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<i>Finally a good process manager.</i><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
By default all actions are <b>graceful</b>. Old processes will always be cleanly<br>
stopped only once new processes have indicated they are <b>ready</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Examples</u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<pre>  &#35; Start processes of all configured applications.                             
  final-pm start all                                                            
</pre></p>

<p>
<pre>  &#35; For each running process, start a new one                                   
  final-pm restart all                                                          
</pre></p>

<p>
<pre>  &#35; Stop all processes gracefully                                               
  final-pm stop all                                                             
</pre></p>

<p>
<pre>  &#35; Stop processes by PID                                                       
  final-pm stop pid=43342,pid=3452                                              
</pre></p>

<p>
<pre>  &#35; Stop processes by application name 'worker'                                 
  final-pm stop worker                                                          
</pre></p>

<p>
<u><b>Arguments</b></u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<pre>  -s, --select Selector      Select processes/applications (see: Selectors)                                
  -a, --action Action        Start/Stop/Restart/... all selected (see: Actions)                            
  -c, --config Config File   Default: ./process-config.{js,json}                                           
                             Load a configuration file into the daemon. For paths beginning with ./ checks 
                             parent folders until a package.json is encountered. If you specified a        
                             config for an already running application, it will be only be applied to new  
                             processes.                                                                    
  --set app-key=value        Override a configuration key.                                                 
  -h, --help                 Print this usage guide.                                                       
</pre></p>

<p>
<u><b>Actions</b></u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Valid actions are <b>start</b>, <b>stop</b>, <b>restart</b>, <b>kill</b>, <b>scale</b>.<br>
All arguments not prefixed with '--' are treated as <i>Action Selector</i> pairs.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>start</u><br>
<br>
Start N=<i>instances</i> processes for all selected applications. When processes are<br>
selected this will start one new process for each selected one instead. May<br>
cause existing processes to be gracefully stopped when the newly started ones<br>
are ready, and will even implicitly stop more processes than were started<br>
when <i>instances</i> was decreased in the configuration. Note that this may replace<br>
different processes than the selected ones, or none at all, if <i>unique-<br>
instances</i> is set to <i>false</i>. In which case the oldest ones of that application<br>
will be replaced if <i>instances</i> was exceeded.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>restart</u><br>
<br>
Same as <b>start</b> except <i>unique-instances</i> is ignored and processes are always<br>
replaced, also stopping processes in case N currently exceeds <i>instances</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>stop</u><br>
<br>
Gracefully stop all selected <i>running</i>/<i>new</i> processes or applications.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>kill</u><br>
<br>
Immediately <b>SIGKILL</b> all selected processes or applications. This works on<br>
processes in any <b>generation</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>scale</u><br>
<br>
Starts or stops processes for each selected application until N matches<br>
configured <i>instances</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u><b>Selectors</b></u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
A Process/Application or comma-separated list of such.<br>
</p>

<p>
A selector can either be an <i>application name</i> or PID (pid=<i>id</i>). Using <b>all</b> as a<br>
selector will target all applications found in the configuration and/or are<br>
running, depending on the action. Prefix with <b>new:</b>, <b>running:</b>, <b>old:</b>, or<br>
<b>marked:</b> to only target processes in that <b>generation</b>.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<u><b>Generations</b></u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Processes are grouped in generations:<br>
The <b>new</b>, <b>running</b>, <b>old</b>, and <b>marked generation</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>New Generation</u><br>
<br>
The <b>new generation</b> is where processes remain until they are considered <b>ready</b>.<br>
A process is considered to be <b>ready</b> on the cluster <b>listen</b> event or when it<br>
sends the <b>ready</b> message, depending on the configuration (config: <b>ready-on</b>).<br>
Once a process is <b>ready</b> it is moved to the <b>running generation</b>. If a process<br>
is asked to be stopped while in the new generation, it is moved to the <b>marked<br>
generation</b> instead. If a process exits abnormally while in the new<br>
generation, a new one is started (config: <b>restart-new-crashing</b>).<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Running Generation</u><br>
<br>
The <b>running generation</b> is where processes remain until they are <b>stopped</b>. At<br>
most the configured amount of processes for each application may reside here.<br>
If <i>unique-instances</i> is set to <i>false</i> and the maximum <i>instances</i> was exceeded<br>
because new processes were started, the oldest processes will be moved to the<br>
<b>old generation</b>. If <i>unique-instances</i> is set to <i>true</i>, each process will<br>
replace its counterpart 1:1 instead, and only then additional processes<br>
stopped if <i>instances</i> is exceeded. If a process exits abnormally while in the<br>
running generation, a new one is started (config: <b>restart-crashing</b>). Note<br>
that an older process can never replace a process that was started later,<br>
ensuring always the latest processes are running even if startup time wildly<br>
varies.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Old Generation</u><br>
<br>
The <b>old generation</b> is where processes remain when they should be <b>stopped</b><br>
until they finally <b>exit</b>. A process moved to the <b>old generation</b> is sent the<br>
<b>SIGINT</b> signal. If the process does not exit within <b>stop-timeout</b> (default is<br>
no timeout), it is sent <b>SIGKILL</b> and removed from the old generation.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Marked Generation</u><br>
<br>
New processes who were asked to stop are kept here, then are moved to the <b>old<br>
generation</b> once they are <b>ready</b>. This means the programmer never has to worry<br>
about handling <b>SIGINT</b> signals during startup.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u><b>Configuration</b></u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Configuration may be done in either JSON or JS, as well as environment<br>
variables and command line arguments. Each configuration key can by overriden<br>
with an environment variable by replacing all dashes in the key with<br>
underscores and translating it to uppercase, finally prefixed with<br>
FINAL_PM_CONFIG_ i.e. restart-new-crashing=true becomes<br>
FINAL_PM_CONFIG_RESTART_NEW_CRASHING=true.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Configuration Files</u><br>
<br>
JS files will be <b>require</b>d with the appropriate <i>NPM_PACKAGE_CONFIG_*</i><br>
environment variables. JSON files on the other hand are parsed as-is.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Logging</u><br>
<br>
Logging is done by a logging process started for each application, which will<br>
be fed logging output via process.send(logLine). The logging process is<br>
automatically started with your application, and is stopped once the last<br>
process of your application exits. By default all applications use the simple<br>
file-logger that ships with final-pm, but creating your own logger is as<br>
simple as creating a new application 'my-logger' which listens to<br>
process.on(...) and setting <i>logger</i> to 'my-logger' in your main application.<br>
Each logger is fed back its own output, so make sure you don't accidentially<br>
call <i>console.log</i> for each log line you receive.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Example Config</u><br>
<br>
<i>final-pm start myApp</i><br>
<br>
</p>

<pre>  // sample-config.js

          'ready-on': 'message',                                       
          'instances': process.env['NPM_PACKAGE_CONFIG_WORKERS'] || 4, 
      ]                                                                
  };
